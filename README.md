# To Buy or not to Buy
Analysis of Online Shopping Intention Data

The purpose of this analysis project is to combine my understanding of online shopping in the retail industry with my knowledge in data analytics, to demonstrate the analytical techniques I have learned from the MicroMasters Program in Analytics offered by Georgia Institute of Technology. 

The Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset from  <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Shoppers+Purchasing+Intention+Dataset#">the UCI Machine Learning Repository</a>, has 12,330 data points and consists of both numerical and categorical attributes. The models I used here include support vector machine, k-nearest-neighbourhood and logistical regression, which helped to detect online shoppers purchasing patterns and forcast their intention. The outline of the analysis is as follows:

1. Generate data visualizations to understand the data structure;
2. Complete data preprocessing  for the modeling;
3. Develop research questions about the data;
4. Apply learning algorithm to compare various models' performances and answer the questions.
